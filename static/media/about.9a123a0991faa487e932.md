# Intro

I'm Kunal Srivastava, a entrepreneur with a knack for data-intensive problem-solving. I think it started in middle school, when I figured out how to change my laptop's MAC address to bypass my parents' internet restrictions on Minecraft 😄.

Fast forward to today, I’ve honed my skills through internships at high-impact companies like Palantir, Microsoft, Skan.ai, and Google, where I solved problems ranging from optimizing serverless architectures to improving accessibility features for millions of users. Each experience has reinforced my belief that the best technology is the kind that empowers users to achieve more with less friction.


# Some history

- I grew up around computers. Throughout my life, I've realized the growing potential these tools have.  

- At 6, My dad bought our family a Google Workspace. Google Draw was my artistic method of choice on our family 2008 iMac.

- At 8, I started to love tennis. I stopped playing other sports to play tennis competively.

- At 9, I won my first tennis tournament: Singles Champion of the Cupertino Junior Open (2011)

- At 11, I wrote my first Python program. I was sick of missing my shots during tennis matches. I recorded my matchplay, and used data visualization to create representations of my shot patterns. All it really did was show me that I needed to improve my consistency (a lot), but this project taught me problem solving and persevereance. 

- I ran a sub-6 minute mile in 7th grade, making it one of the happiest days of my life. I finished with the exact same time as my best friend. This is one of my most cherished memories. 

- At 14, I wrote an algorithm to evaulate and solve quadratic equations. I saw the repetitive process I was doing by hand, and slowly reproduced it in code. On my next homework, I was unstoppable.

- At 15, I placed in the Distinguished Honor Roll (top 1%) of the AMC10 (American Mathematics Competition)

- At 16, I fractured my lower back playing tennis. For those of you familiar with tennis, my back was too worn-down from thousands of kick serves. I was out for 6 months. My first big injury taught me a lot about patience and self-care. 

- For three summers in high school, I participated in the Google Apprenticeship, where I learned about the various aspects and cycles of the tech industry. I created three full stack applications solving impactful problems, like overflowing calls to businesses during COVID-19. For my last summer in the program, I served as a Tech Lead to the other Apprentices. 

- I trained at IMG Academy, a tennis boarding school in Florida, 4 times. 6 hours on the court, 2 hours in the gym, 1 hour to eat, and 8 to sleep. 6 days a week. I learned to work really hard. 

- At 17, I published my first academic paper. I completed knowledge graph research at Stanford University. I worked on making better Amazon product recommendations using link prediction modeling and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

- At 18, I took my first undergraduate course and published my second academic paper on Race and Gender Biases in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

- At 19, I received a $2,500 credit grant from OpenAI to build something amazing.

- At 20, I founded Terra and Varro. Terra simplified Zoom meetings for neurdivergent individuals with a simple UI, winning the Lavin Entrepreneurship Competition. Varro was a fact-based research search engine, placing runner-up at the UW DubHacks Hackathon. 

- At 21, I interned at Palantir. This is probably the turning point of my early career - where I realized that I had the skill, potential, and grit to drive immense impact across many use cases. Now, I'm confident I can build anything...

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.

# Fun facts

- I keep a product list of what to cook next. 
- Figured out how to bot registration for my undergraduate courses. Unfortunately, this is not allowed. 
- Now, tennis and golf are my safe places where I go to cool off and reset my mind. 
- I love to invest. I have a thesis-based investment strategy that highly depends on updating my tech industry knowledge daily.

# I dream of

- Leading by example.
- Enabling a brighter future for everyone, regardless of political or socioeconomic status.
- Treating every individual with genuine kindness and respect.
- Respect the sacrifices my parents have made for me by making them so proud.
