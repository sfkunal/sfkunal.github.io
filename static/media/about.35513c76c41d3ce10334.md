# Intro

I'm Kunal Srivastava, a passionate Informatics and Data Science student at the University of Washington. I've interned at Microsoft (2x), Skan.ai, and Google, contributing to full-stack, machine learning, and automation projects. As a Founding Engineer at Otto, I helped raise $2 million to create a mobile pet-care interface. I co-founded the winner of the Lavin Entrepreneurship Startup Studio, Terra, simplifying online meetings. My research explores ethical AI, addressing racial bias in Convolutional Neural Networks. I am particularly interested in projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.

# Some history

- I grew up around computers. Throughout my life, I've realized the growing potential these tools have.  

- At 6, My dad bought our family a Google Workspace. Google Draw was my artistic method of choice on our family 2008 iMac.

- At 8, I started to love tennis. I stopped playing other sports to play tennis competively.

- At 9, I won my first tennis tournament: Singles Champion of the Cupertino Junior Open (2011)

- At 11, I wrote my first Python program. I was sick of missing my shots during tennis matches. I recorded my matchplay, and used data visualization to create representations of my shot patterns. All it really did was show me that I needed to improve my consistency (a lot), but this project taught me problem solving and persevereance. 

- I ran a sub-6 minute mile in 7th grade, making it one of the happiest days of my life. I finished with the exact same time as my best friend. This is one of my most cherished memories. 

- At 14, I wrote an algorithm to evaulate and solve quadratic equations. I saw the repetitive process I was doing by hand, and slowly reproduced it in code. On my next homework, I was unstoppable.

- At 15, I placed in the Distinguished Honor Roll (top 1%) of the AMC10 (American Mathematics Competition)

- At 16, I fractured my lower back playing tennis. For those of you familiar with tennis, my back was too worn-down from thousands of kick serves. I was out for 6 months. My first big injury taught me a lot about patience and self-care. 

- For three summers in high school, I participated in the Google Apprenticeship, where I learned about the various aspects and cycles of the tech industry. I created three full stack applications solving impactful problems, like overflowing calls to businesses during COVID-19. For my last summer in the program, I served as a Tech Lead to the other Apprentices. 

- I trained at IMG Academy, a tennis boarding school in Florida, 4 times. 6 hours on the court, 2 hours in the gym, 1 hour to eat, and 8 to sleep. 6 days a week. I learned to work really hard. 

- At 17, I published my first academic paper. I completed knowledge graph research at Stanford University. I worked on making better Amazon product recommendations using link prediction modeling and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

- At 18, I took my first undergraduate course and published my second academic paper on Race and Gender Biases in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

- At 19, I received a $2,500 credit grant from OpenAI to build something amazing.

- At 20, I founded Terra and Varro. Terra simplified Zoom meetings for neurdivergent individuals with a simple UI, winning the Lavin Entrepreneurship Competition. Varro was a fact-based research search engine, placing runner-up at the UW DubHacks Hackathon. 

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.

# Travel / Geography

- I grew up in Hillsborough, California. I have since lived in Palo Alto and Seattle.

# Fun facts

- I keep an encrypted list of my best current entrepreneurship ideas. I'm always looking to build something awesome. 
- Figured out how to bot registration for my undergraduate courses. Unfortunately, this is not allowed. 
- Now, tennis and golf are my safe places where I go to cool off and reset my mind. 
- I love to invest. I have a thesis-based investment strategy that highly depends on updating my industry knowledge daily.

# I dream of
